## AI assisted coding

Using AI assisted coding tools for auto complete, test generation, etc is allowed so long as a human is the overall primary author of a pull request.

Contributions from supervised AI assisted coding agents who build the majority (or all of) a change, such as [co pilot tasks](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-28-a-mission-control-to-assign-steer-and-track-copilot-coding-agent-tasks/), will be accepted only on the following basis:

1. A human can verifiably prove they have reviewed and checked that the contribution does what it says it does.
2. The human author provides evidence of the prompt given to the AI agent, and the logs of it producing the change. (For example - co pilot tasks produces a public log).
3. The human author explicitly calls out that an supervised AI agent created the change when they make a pull request.
4. The human author is prepared to own the change (just like any other change they make) and fix any issues that arise from it.


## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/pokeapi).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.

## Questions

If you have any questions, create an [issue](issue) (protip: do a quick search first to see if someone else didn't ask the same question before!).
You can also reach us at hello@pokeapi.opencollective.com.
