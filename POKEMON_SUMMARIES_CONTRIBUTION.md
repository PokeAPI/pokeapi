# Pokemon Summaries Contribution

This contribution adds Pokemon summaries functionality to the PokeAPI, allowing individual Pokemon to have descriptive summaries in multiple languages.

## What's Added

### 1. Database Model
- **PokemonSummary Model**: Links individual Pokemon to summary text with language support
- **Unique Constraint**: Each Pokemon can have only one summary per language
- **Migration**: `0019_pokemonsummary.py` creates the new table

### 2. API Integration
- **PokemonSummaryTextSerializer**: Serializes summary data with language information
- **Updated PokemonDetailSerializer**: Now includes a `summaries` field in Pokemon API responses
- **Multilingual Support**: Summaries can be provided in any language supported by PokeAPI

### 3. Data Import Script
- **import_summaries.py**: Script to import summaries from your PostgreSQL database
- **Flexible Query**: Easily adaptable to your existing database schema
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing Pokemon or languages

### 4. Tests
- **PokemonSummaryTestCase**: Tests for model creation and unique constraints
- **Integration Tests**: Ensures the functionality works as expected

## API Usage

Once summaries are imported, they will be available in the Pokemon detail endpoint:

```bash
GET /api/v2/pokemon/pikachu/
```

Response will include:
```json
{
  "id": 25,
  "name": "pikachu",
  "summaries": [
    {
      "summary": "Pikachu is an Electric-type Pok√©mon known for its yellow fur and red cheeks.",
      "language": {
        "name": "en",
        "url": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/language/9/"
      }
    }
  ],
  // ... other Pokemon data
}
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Apply the Migration
```bash
python3 manage.py migrate pokemon_v2
```

### 2. Import Your Summaries
```bash
python3 import_summaries.py \
  --host your_production_host \
  --port 5432 \
  --database your_database \
  --user your_username \
  --password your_password
```

### 3. Customize the Import Script
You may need to modify the SQL query in `import_summaries.py` to match your database schema:

```python
query = """
SELECT 
    pokemon_name,        -- Your Pokemon name column
    language_code,       -- Your language code column  
    summary_text         -- Your summary text column
FROM your_summaries_table
WHERE summary_text IS NOT NULL AND summary_text != ''
"""
```

## Database Schema

The new `pokemon_summary` table has the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE pokemon_summary (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    summary TEXT NOT NULL,
    language_id INTEGER REFERENCES language(id),
    pokemon_id INTEGER REFERENCES pokemon(id),
    UNIQUE(pokemon_id, language_id)
);
```

## Testing

Run the tests to ensure everything works:

```bash
python3 manage.py test pokemon_v2.test_models.PokemonSummaryTestCase
```

## Contributing Guidelines

This contribution follows PokeAPI's existing patterns:

1. **Model Structure**: Uses existing abstract base classes (`HasPokemon`, `HasLanguage`)
2. **Serializer Pattern**: Follows the same pattern as other multilingual content
3. **API Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing Pokemon endpoints
4. **Testing**: Includes comprehensive tests
5. **Documentation**: Well-documented code and usage instructions

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Admin interface for managing summaries
- Bulk import/export functionality
- Summary validation and moderation
- Integration with existing flavor text system
