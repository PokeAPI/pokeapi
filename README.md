## Fair use policy

PokéAPI is open and free to use. However, we will ban IP addresses that abuse this privilege. This API is used primarily for educational purposes, and we do not want people inhibiting the education of others. See the fair use guide on the docs for more information.

## Donations

Help to keep PokéAPI running! If you're using PokéAPI as a teaching resource or for a project, consider sending us a $10 donation to help keep the server up. We get over 2 million requests a month and it's quite costly!

See [the bottom of the home page](https://pokeapi.co) to donate.


## DEPRECATION

Quite a lot of data is missing from the V1 API.

**As of January 2015, no new data will be added to the v1 API, you will have to use the V2 API instead.**

See [This blog post for more information](http://phalt.co/if-you-have-data-they-will-consume-it).

## Setup

- Download this source code into a working directory.

- Install the requirements using pip:
```
$ make install
```
This will install all the required packages and libraries for using PokeAPI

- Set up the local developer environment using the following command:
```
$ make setup
```
- Run the server using the following command::
```
$ make serve
```
Visit localhost:8000 to see the running website!

If you ever need to wipe the database use this command:
```
$ make wipe_db
```

## V1 Database setup

Start Django shell
```
$ python manage.py shell --settings=config.local
```
import build functions
```
$ from data.v1.build import *
```
run the functions in order to populate v1 tables
```
$ build_pokes()
$ build_abilities()
$ build moves()
etc...
```


## V2 Database setup

Start Django shell
```
$ python manage.py shell --settings=config.local
```

run the build script with
```
$ from data.v2.build import build_all
$ build_all()
```
Each time the build script is run it will iterate over each table in the database, wipe it and rewrite each row using the data found in data/v2/csv.
When building against sqlite we've heard it can take a ridiculously long time to finish building out the database. In this case you can set up just the portions of the db that you need.
```
$ from data.v2.build import *
$ build_languages()
$ build_abilities()
...
```

Heres a list of the data building functions
- build_languages()
- build_regions()
- build_generations()
- build_versions()
- build_stats()
- build_damage_classes()
- build_abilities()
- build_characteristics()
- build_egg_groups()
- build_growth_rates()
- build_items()
- build_types()
- build_contests()
- build_moves()
- build_berries()
- build_natures()
- build_genders()
- build_experiences()
- build_machines()
- build_evolutions()
- build_pokedexes()
- build_locations()
- build_pokemons()
- build_encounters()
- build_pal_parks()


## Docker

The application can be built and run as a Docker container for easy deployments

From the root directory of the cloned repo
```
docker build -t pokeapi .
```

Run the container on host port 8000
```
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 pokeapi
```


## Docker Compose

There is also a multi-container setup, managed by [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). This setup allow you to deploy a production-like environment, with separate containers for each services.

Create data volumes for Redis and Postgres
```
docker volume create --name=redis_data
docker volume create --name=pg_data
```

Start the process using
```
docker-compose up
```
You can specify the ```-d``` switch to start in detached mode.   
This will bind port 80 and 443. Unfortunately, unlike the ```docker``` command, there is no command line arguments to specify ports. If you want to change them, edit the ```docker-compose.yml``` file.

After that, start the migration process
```
docker-compose exec app python manage.py migrate
```

And then, import the data using the shell
```
docker-compose exec app python manage.py shell
```

You can use the ```build_all()``` method, or individuals data building functions (See _V2 Database setup_)
```
from data.v2.build import build_all
build_all()
```

For the moment, this setup doesn't allow you to use the ```scale``` command.
