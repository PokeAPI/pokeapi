A RESTful API for Pokémon - [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co)

> Beta GraphQL support is rolling out! Check out the [GraphQL paragraph](#graphql--) for more info.

## Setup &nbsp; [![pyVersion310](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.10/)

- Download this source code into a working directory, be sure to use the flag `--recurse-submodules` to clone also our submodules.

- Install the requirements using pip:

    ```sh
    make install
    # This will install all the required packages and libraries for using PokeAPI
    ```

- Set up the local development environment using the following command:

    ```sh
    make setup
    ```

- Run the server on port `8000` using the following command:

    ```sh
    make serve
    ```

### Database setup

To build or rebuild the database by applying any CSV file update, run

```sh
make build-db
```

Visit [localhost:8000/api/v2/](http://localhost:8000/api/v2/) to see the running API!

Each time the `build-db` script is run, it will iterate over each table in the database, wipe it, and rewrite each row using the data found in data/v2/csv.

If you ever need to wipe the database use this command:

```sh
make wipe-sqlite-db
```

If the database schema has changed, generate any outstanding migrations and apply them

```sh
make make-migrations
make migrate
```

Run `make help` to see all tasks.

## Docker and Compose &nbsp; [![docker hub](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/pokeapi/pokeapi?label=tag&sort=semver)](https://hub.docker.com/r/pokeapi/pokeapi)

There is also a multi-container setup, managed by [Docker Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). This setup allows you to deploy a production-like environment, with separate containers for each service, and is recommended if you need to simply spin up PokéAPI.

Start everything by

```sh
make docker-setup
```

If you don't have `make` on your machine you can use the following commands

```sh
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec -T app python manage.py migrate --settings=config.docker-compose
docker compose exec -T app sh -c 'echo "from data.v2.build import build_all; build_all()" | python manage.py shell --settings=config.docker-compose'
```

Browse [localhost/api/v2/](http://localhost/api/v2/) or [localhost/api/v2/pokemon/bulbasaur/](http://localhost/api/v2/pokemon/bulbasaur/) on port `80`.

To rebuild the database and apply any CSV file updates, run

```sh
make docker-build-db
```

If the database schema has changed, generate the migrations and apply those

```sh
make docker-make-migrations
make docker-migrate
```

## GraphQL &nbsp; <a href="ttps://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine"><img height="29px" src="https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/img/powered_by_hasura_blue.svg"/></a>

When you start PokéAPI with the above Docker Compose setup, an [Hasura Engine](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine) server is started as well. It's possible to track all the PokeAPI tables and foreign keys by simply

```sh
# hasura cli needs to be installed and available in your $PATH: https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/hasura-cli/install-hasura-cli.html
# hasura cli's version has to greater than v2.0.8
make hasura-apply
```

When finished browse http://localhost:8080 and you will find the admin console. The GraphQL endpoint will be hosted at http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql.

A free public GraphiQL console is browsable at the address https://beta.pokeapi.co/graphql/console/. The relative GraphQL endpoint is accessible at https://beta.pokeapi.co/graphql/v1beta

A set of examples is provided in the directory [/graphql/examples](./graphql/examples) of this repository.

## Kubernetes &nbsp; [![Build Docker image and create k8s with it](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi/actions/workflows/docker-k8s.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi/actions/workflows/docker-k8s.yml)

[Kustomize](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/) files are provided in the folder https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi/tree/master/Resources/k8s/kustomize/base/. Create and change your secrets:

```sh
cp Resources/k8s/kustomize/base/secrets/postgres.env.sample Resources/k8s/kustomize/base/secrets/postgres.env
cp Resources/k8s/kustomize/base/secrets/graphql.env.sample Resources/k8s/kustomize/base/secrets/graphql.env
cp Resources/k8s/kustomize/base/config/pokeapi.env.sample Resources/k8s/kustomize/base/config/pokeapi.env
# Edit the newly created files
```

Configure `kubectl` to point to a cluster and then run the following commands to start a PokéAPI service.

```sh
kubectl apply -k Resources/k8s/kustomize/base/
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace pokeapi # (Optional) Set pokeapi ns as the working ns
# Wait for the cluster to spin up
kubectl exec --namespace pokeapi deployment/pokeapi -- python manage.py migrate --settings=config.docker-compose # Migrate the DB
kubectl exec --namespace pokeapi deployment/pokeapi -- sh -c 'echo "from data.v2.build import build_all; build_all()" | python manage.py shell --settings=config.docker-compose' # Build the db
kubectl wait --namespace pokeapi --timeout=120s --for=condition=complete job/load-graphql # Wait for Graphql configuration job to finish
```

This k8s setup creates all k8s resources inside the _Namespace_ `pokeapi`, run `kubectl delete namespace pokeapi` to delete them. It also creates a _Service_ of type `LoadBalancer` which is exposed on port `80` and `443`. Data is persisted on `12Gi` of `ReadWriteOnce` volumes.
