If the user leaves the [field]{mechanic:field}, the doll will vanish.  If the user cannot pay the [HP]{mechanic:hp} cost, this move will fail.

The doll takes damage as normal, using the user's stats and types, and will break when its [HP]{mechanic:hp} reaches zero.  Self-inflicted damage from [confusion]{mechanic:confusion} or recoil is not absorbed.  Healing effects from opponents ignore the doll and heal the user as normal.  Moves that work based on the user's [HP]{mechanic:hp} still do so; the doll's [HP]{mechanic:hp} does not influence any move.

The effects of []{move:smelling-salts} and []{move:wake-up-slap} do not trigger against a doll, even if the Pokémon behind the doll has the appropriate [major status effect]{mechanic:major-status-effect}.  Multi-turn trapping moves like []{move:wrap} will hit the doll for their [regular damage]{mechanic:regular-damage}, but the multi-turn trapping and damage effects will not activate.

[]{move:magic-coat} still works as normal, even against moves the doll would block.  Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like []{move:absorb} are healed as normal.

It will also block []{move:acupressure}, []{move:block}, the curse effect of []{move:curse}, []{move:dream-eater}, []{move:embargo}, []{move:flatter}, []{move:gastro-acid}, []{move:grudge}, []{move:heal-block}, []{move:leech-seed}, []{move:lock-on}, []{move:mean-look}, []{move:mimic}, []{move:mind-reader}, []{move:nightmare}, []{move:pain-split}, []{move:psycho-shift}, []{move:spider-web}, []{move:sketch}, []{move:swagger}, []{move:switcheroo}, []{move:trick}, []{move:worry-seed}, and []{move:yawn}.  A Pokémon affected by []{move:yawn} before summoning the doll will still fall to [sleep]{mechanic:sleep}.

The doll blocks []{ability:intimidate}, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist.  If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for [HP]{mechanic:hp} (such as []{ability:volt-absorb} absorbing []{move:thunder-wave}), such moves will not be blocked.

[]{item:life-orb} and berries that cause [confusion]{mechanic:confusion} still work as normal, but their respective [HP]{mechanic:hp} loss and [confusion]{mechanic:confusion} are absorbed/blocked by the doll.

The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the [field]{mechanic:field}, such as by []{move:pursuit} or []{move:spikes}; however, the doll will block the [poison]{mechanic:poison} effect of []{move:toxic-spikes}.

The doll is passed on by []{move:baton-pass}.  It keeps its existing [HP]{mechanic:hp}, but uses the replacement Pokémon's stats and types for damage calculation.
