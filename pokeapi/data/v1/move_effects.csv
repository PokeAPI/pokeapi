If the user leaves the [field], the doll will vanish.  If the user cannot pay the [HP] cost, this move will fail.

The doll takes damage as normal, using the user's stats and types, and will break when its [HP] reaches zero.  Self-inflicted damage from [confusion] or recoil is not absorbed.  Healing effects from opponents ignore the doll and heal the user as normal.  Moves that work based on the user's [HP] still do so; the doll's [HP] does not influence any move.

life-orb and berries that cause [confusion] still work as normal, but their respective [HP] loss and [confusion] are absorbed/blocked by the doll.

The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the [field], such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the [poison] effect of toxic-spikes.

The doll is passed on by baton-pass.  It keeps its existing [HP], but uses the replacement Pokémon's stats and types for damage calculation.
