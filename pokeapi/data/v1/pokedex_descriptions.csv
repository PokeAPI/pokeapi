releases enough psychic power to
grind a 10-ton truck into dust."

emit psychic energy. It keeps the patterns tightly
covered because that power is too immense."

departed spirit inhabits a sword. It attaches itself
to people and drinks their life force."

and emits scents that its enemies dislike in order

happens to really enjoy the smell, he or she will
have a hard time walking alongside it."
684,23,9,"To entangle its opponents in battle, it extrudes
white threads as sweet and sticky as cotton candy."
684,24,9,"Because it eats nothing but sweets,
its fur is as sticky sweet as cotton candy."
685,23,9,"It can distinguish the faintest of scents.
It puts its sensitive sense of smell to use
by helping pastry chefs in their work."
685,24,9,"Its sense of smell is 100 million times better than
a human’s, so even the faintest scent tells it about
everything in the area. It’s like it can see with its nose!"

light-emitting spots on its body become
dazed and lose their will to fight."

rocks along with them in bold hops. They eat
seaweed that washes up on the shoreline."

They fight with the power of seven Binacle."

of their own, and they will move independently.
But they usually follow the head’s orders."

liquid poison on prey that approaches
unawares and then finish it off."
690,24,9,"It looks just like rotten kelp. It hides from foes
while storing up power for its evolution."

the hull of a tanker, and they spit it indiscriminately
at anything that enters their territory."

that generate electricity when exposed to sunlight."

force that it can chew up an automobile.

it can instantly create a wall of
ice to block an opponent’s attack."

power plants or from outlets in houses,
and then it fires the electricity from its whiskers."

deep underground, it fires beams from the
stone in its head."
