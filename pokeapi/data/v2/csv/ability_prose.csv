This ability does not stack with a held item.

Overworld: The wild encounter rate is halved while this Pokémon is first in the party."
2,9,Summons [rain]{mechanic:rain} that lasts indefinitely upon entering battle.,"The [weather]{mechanic:weather} changes to [rain]{mechanic:rain} when this Pokémon enters battle and does not end unless replaced by another weather condition.

If multiple Pokémon with this ability, []{ability:drought}, []{ability:sand-stream}, or []{ability:snow-warning} are sent out at the same time, the abilities will activate in order of [Speed]{mechanic:speed}, respecting []{move:trick-room}.

Regardless of its current HP, it is also immune to the one-hit KO moves: []{move:fissure}, []{move:guillotine}, []{move:horn-drill}, and []{move:sheer-cold}.

If this Pokémon is holding a []{item:focus-sash}, this ability takes precedence and the item will not be consumed."
6,9,"Prevents []{move:self-destruct}, []{move:explosion}, and []{ability:aftermath} from working while the Pokémon is in battle.","While this Pokémon is in battle, []{move:self-destruct} and []{move:explosion} will fail and []{ability:aftermath} will not take effect."
7,9,Prevents [paralysis]{mechanic:paralysis}.,"This Pokémon cannot be [paralyzed]{mechanic:paralysis}.

If a Pokémon is paralyzed and acquires this ability, its paralysis is healed; this includes when regaining a lost ability upon leaving battle."
8,9,Increases [evasion]{mechanic:evasion} to 1.25× during a [sandstorm]{mechanic:sandstorm}.  Protects against sandstorm damage.,"During a [sandstorm]{mechanic:sandstorm}, this Pokémon has 1.25× its [evasion]{mechanic:evasion}, and it does not take sandstorm damage regardless of type.

16,9,Changes type to match when hit by a damaging move.,"Whenever this Pokémon takes damage from a move, the Pokémon's type changes to match the move.

If the Pokémon has two types, both are overridden.  The Pokémon must directly take damage; for example, moves blocked by a []{move:substitute} will not trigger this ability, nor will moves that deal damage indirectly, such as []{move:spikes}.

This ability takes effect on only the last hit of a multiple-hit attack.

In Pokémon Colosseum and XD: Gale of Darkness, this ability does not take effect on Shadow-type moves."

If a Pokémon is poisoned and acquires this ability, its poison is healed; this includes when regaining a lost ability upon leaving battle."

Moves that inflict fixed damage, such as []{move:night-shade} or []{move:seismic-toss}, are considered super effective if their types are.  Damage not directly dealt by moves, such as damage from [weather]{mechanic:weather}, a [status ailment]{mechanic:status-ailment}, or []{move:spikes}, is not prevented.

This ability cannot be copied with []{move:role-play} or traded away with []{move:skill-swap}, but it can be copied with []{ability:trace}, disabled with []{move:gastro-acid}, or changed with []{move:worry-seed}.

27,9,"Has a 30% chance of inflcting either [paralysis]{mechanic:paralysis}, [poison]{mechanic:poison}, or [sleep]{mechanic:sleep} on attacking Pokémon on contact.","Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, the move's user has a 30% chance of being [paralyzed]{mechanic:paralysis}, [poisoned]{mechanic:poison}, or put to [sleep]{mechanic:sleep}, chosen at random.

Nothing is done to compensate if the move's user is immune to one of these ailments; there is simply a lower chance that the move's user will be affected."
28,9,"Copies [burns]{mechanic:burn}, [paralysis]{mechanic:paralysis}, and [poison]{mechanic:poison} received onto the Pokémon that inflicted them.","Whenever this Pokémon is [burned]{mechanic:burn}, [paralyzed]{mechanic:paralysis}, or [poisoned]{mechanic:poison}, the Pokémon who gave this Pokémon that ailment is also given the ailment.

This ability passes back bad poison when this Pokémon is badly poisoned.  This ability cannot pass on a status ailment that the Pokémon did not directly receive from another Pokémon, such as the poison from []{move:toxic-spikes} or the burn from a []{item:flame-orb}.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, wild Pokémon have a 50% chance of having the lead Pokémon's nature, and a 50% chance of being given a random nature as usual, including the lead Pokémon's nature.  This does not work on Pokémon received outside of battle or roaming legendaries."
29,9,Prevents stats from being [lowered]{mechanic:stat-modifier} by other Pokémon.,"This Pokémon cannot have its stats [lowered]{mechanic:stat-modifier} by other Pokémon.

30,9,Cures any [major status ailment]{mechanic:major-status-ailment} upon switching out.,"This Pokémon is cured of any [major status ailment]{mechanic:major-status-ailment} when it is switched out for another Pokémon.

31,9,"Redirects single-target []{type:electric} moves to this Pokémon where possible.  Absorbs Electric moves, raising [Special Attack]{mechanic:special-attack} one [stage]{mechanic:stat-modifier}.","All other Pokémon's single-target []{type:electric}-type moves are redirected to this Pokémon if it is an eligible target.  Other Pokémon's Electric moves raise this Pokémon's [Special Attack]{mechanic:special-attack} one [stage]{mechanic:stat-modifier}, negating any other effect on it, and cannot miss it.

If the move's intended target also has this ability, the move is not redirected.  When multiple Pokémon with this ability are possible targets for redirection, the move is redirected to the one with the highest [Speed]{mechanic:speed} stat, or, in the case of a tie, to a random tied Pokémon.  []{move:follow-me} takes precedence over this ability.

If the Pokémon is a []{type:ground}-type and thus immune to Electric moves, its immunity prevents the Special Attack boost."
32,9,Doubles the chance of moves' extra effects occurring.,"This Pokémon's moves have twice their usual effect chance.

An effect chance is a move's chance to inflict a [status ailment]{mechanic:status-ailment}, cause a [stat change]{mechanic:stat-modifier}, or make the target [flinch]{mechanic:flinching} in addition to the move's main effect.  For example, []{move:flamethrower}'s chance of [burning]{mechanic:burn} the target is doubled, but []{move:protect}'s chance of success and []{move:air-cutter}'s increased [critical hit]{mechanic:critical-hit} rate are unaffected.

[]{move:secret-power} is unaffected."

This effect does not stack if multiple Pokémon have this ability or []{ability:flame-body}."

45,9,Summons a [sandstorm]{mechanic:sandstorm} that lasts indefinitely upon entering battle.,"The [weather]{mechanic:weather} changes to a [sandstorm]{mechanic:sandstorm} when this Pokémon enters battle and does not end unless cancelled by another weather condition.

If multiple Pokémon with this ability, []{ability:drizzle}, []{ability:drought}, or []{ability:snow-warning} are sent out at the same time, the abilities will activate in order of [Speed]{mechanic:speed}, respecting []{move:trick-room}.  Each ability's weather will cancel the previous weather, and only the weather summoned by the slowest of the Pokémon will stay.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is halved in a sandstorm."
46,9,Increases the [PP]{mechanic:pp} cost of moves targetting the Pokémon by one.,"Moves targetting this Pokémon use one extra [PP]{mechanic:pp}.

This ability stacks if multiple targets have it.  This ability still affects moves that fail or miss.  This ability does not affect ally moves that target either the entire field or just its side, nor this Pokémon's self-targetted moves; it does, however, affect single-targetted ally moves aimed at this Pokémon, ally moves that target all other Pokémon, and opponents' moves that target the entire field.  If this ability raises a move's PP cost above its remaining PP, it will use all remaining PP.

When this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, higher-levelled Pokémon have their encounter rate increased."

If this Pokémon's sleep counter is at 1, it will fall to 0 and then the Pokémon will wake up."

Overworld: If any Pokémon in the party has this ability, each egg in the party has its [hatch counter]{mechanic:hatch-counter} decreased by 2 (rather than 1) each [step cycle]{mechanic:step-cycle}, making eggs hatch roughly twice as quickly.  This effect does not stack if multiple Pokémon have this ability or []{ability:magma-armor}."

51,9,Prevents [accuracy]{mechanic:accuracy} from being [lowered]{mechanic:stat-modifier}.,"This Pokémon cannot have its [accuracy]{mechanic:accuracy} [lowered]{mechanic:stat-modifier}.

This ability does not prevent any accuracy losses other than [stat modifiers]{mechanic:stat-modifiers}, such as the accuracy cut from [fog]{mechanic:fog}; nor does it prevent other Pokémon's [evasion]{mechanic:evasion} from making this Pokémon's moves less accurate.  This Pokémon can still be passed negative accuracy modifiers through []{move:heart-swap}.

Overworld: If the first Pokémon in the party has this ability, any random encounter with a Pokémon five or more levels lower than it has a 50% chance of being skipped."
52,9,Prevents [Attack]{mechanic:attack} from being [lowered]{mechanic:stat-modifiers} by other Pokémon.,"This Pokémon's [Attack]{mechanic:attack} cannot be [lowered]{mechanic:stat-modifier} by other Pokémon.

The []{item:air-balloon} and []{item:eject-button} cannot be picked up.

54,9,Skips every second turn.,"Every second turn on which this Pokémon should attempt to use a move, it will instead do nothing (""loaf around"").

Loafing around interrupts moves that take multiple turns the same way [paralysis]{mechanic:paralysis}, [flinching]{mechanic:flinching}, etc do.  Most such moves, for example []{move:bide} or []{move:rollout}, are simply cut off upon loafing around.  Attacks with a recharge turn, such as []{move:hyper-beam}, do not have to recharge; attacks with a preparation turn, such as []{move:fly}, do not end up being used.  Moves that are forced over multiple turns and keep going through failure, such as []{move:outrage}, []{move:uproar}, or any move forced by []{move:encore}, keep going as usual.

If this Pokémon is [confused]{mechanic:confusion}, its confusion is not checked when loafing around; the Pokémon cannot hurt itself, and its confusion does not end or come closer to ending.

If this Pokémon attempts to move but fails, e.g. because of [paralysis]{mechanic:paralysis} or []{move:gravity}, it still counts as having moved and will loaf around the next turn.  If it does not attempt to move, e.g. because it is [asleep]{mechanic:sleep} or [frozen]{mechanic:freezing}, whatever it would have done will be postponed until its next attempt; that is, it will either loaf around or move as usual, depending on what it last did.

This ability cannot be changed with []{move:worry-seed}, but it can be disabled with []{move:gastro-acid}, changed with []{move:role-play}, or traded away with []{move:skill-swap}."
55,9,"Strengthens physical moves to inflict 1.5× damage, but decreases their [accuracy]{mechanic:accuracy} to 0.8×.","This Pokémon's physical moves do 1.5× as much [regular damage]{mechanic:regular-damage}, but have 0.8× their usual [accuracy]{mechanic:accuracy}.

56,9,Has a 30% chance of [infatuating]{mechanic:infatuation} attacking Pokémon on contact.,"Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, the move's user has a 30% chance of being [infatuated]{mechanic:infatuation}.

59,9,Changes []{pokemon:castform}'s type and form to match the [weather]{mechanic:weather}.,"During [rain]{mechanic:rain}, [strong sunlight]{mechanic:strong-sunlight}, or [hail]{mechanic:hail}, this Pokémon's type changes to []{type:water}, []{type:fire}, or []{type:ice}, respectively, and its form changes to match.

This ability has no effect for any Pokémon other than []{pokemon:castform}.

If the [weather]{mechanic:weather} ends or becomes anything that does not trigger this ability, or a Pokémon with []{ability:air-lock} or []{ability:cloud-nine} enters battle, this Pokémon's type and form revert to their default.  If this ability is lost or disabled, this Pokémon cannot change its current type and form until it regains its ability."
60,9,Prevents a held item from being removed by other Pokémon.,"This Pokémon's hold item cannot be removed by other Pokémon.

Damaging moves that would remove this Pokémon's item can still inflict damage against this Pokémon, e.g. []{move:knock-off} or []{move:pluck}.  This Pokémon can still use moves that involve the loss of its own item, e.g. []{move:fling} or []{move:trick}.

This bonus does not count as a [stat modifier]{mechanic:stat-modifier}."
64,9,Damages opponents using leeching moves for as much as they would heal.,"Whenever a Pokémon would heal after hitting this Pokémon with a leeching move like []{move:absorb}, it instead loses as many [HP]{mechanic:hp} as it would usually gain.

[]{move:dream-eater} is unaffected."
65,9,Strengthens []{type:grass} moves to inflict 1.5× damage at 1/3 max [HP]{mechanic:hp} or less.,"When this Pokémon has 1/3 or less of its [HP]{mechanic:hp} remaining, its []{type:grass}-type moves inflict 1.5× as much [regular damage]{mechanic:regular-damage}."

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is increased."
69,9,Protects against recoil damage.,"This Pokémon does not receive recoil damage from its recoil moves.

[]{move:struggle}'s recoil is unaffected.  This ability does not prevent crash damage from missing with []{move:jump-kick} or []{move:high-jump-kick}."
70,9,Summons [strong sunlight]{mechanic:strong-sunlight} that lasts indefinitely upon entering battle.,"The [weather]{mechanic:weather} changes to [strong sunlight]{mechanic:strong-sunlight} when this Pokémon enters battle and does not end unless cancelled by another weather condition.

If multiple Pokémon with this ability, []{ability:drizzle}, []{ability:sand-stream}, or []{ability:snow-warning} are sent out at the same time, the abilities will activate in order of [Speed]{mechanic:speed}, respecting []{move:trick-room}.  Each ability's weather will cancel the previous weather, and only the weather summoned by the slowest of the Pokémon will stay."
71,9,Prevents opponents from fleeing or switching out.  Eluded by []{type:flying}-types and Pokémon in the air.,"While this Pokémon is in battle, opposing Pokémon cannot flee or switch out.  []{type:flying}-type Pokémon and Pokémon in the air, e.g. due to []{ability:levitate} or []{move:magnet-rise}, are unaffected.

Pokémon with []{ability:run-away} can still flee.  Pokémon can still switch out with the use of a move or item.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is doubled."
72,9,Prevents [sleep]{mechanic:sleep}.,"This Pokémon cannot be [asleep]{mechanic:sleep}.

This causes []{move:rest} to fail altogether.  If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires this ability, it will immediately wake up; this includes when regaining a lost ability upon leaving battle.

This ability functions identically to []{ability:insomnia} in battle.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, higher-levelled Pokémon have their encounter rate increased."
73,9,Prevents stats from being [lowered]{mechanic:stat-modifier} by other Pokémon.,"This Pokémon cannot have its stats [lowered]{mechanic:stat-modifier} by other Pokémon.

This ability does not prevent any stat losses other than [stat modifiers]{mechanic:stat-modifiers}, such as the [Speed]{mechanic:speed} cut from [paralysis]{mechanic:paralysis}; nor self-inflicted stat drops, such as the [Special Attack]{mechanic:special-attack} drop from []{move:overheat}; nor opponent-triggered stat boosts, such as the [Attack]{mechanic:attack} boost from []{move:swagger}.  This Pokémon can still be passed negative stat modifiers through []{move:guard-swap}, []{move:heart-swap}, or []{move:power-swap}.

This ability functions identically to []{ability:clear-body} in battle.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is halved."
74,9,Doubles [Attack]{mechanic:attack} in battle.,"This Pokémon's [Attack]{mechanic:attack} is doubled in battle.

This bonus does not count as a [stat modifier]{mechanic:stat-modifier}.

This ability functions identically to []{ability:huge-power}."
75,9,Protects against [critical hits]{mechanic:critical-hit}.,"Moves cannot score [critical hits]{mechanic:critical-hit} against this Pokémon.

This ability functions identically to []{ability:battle-armor}."
76,9,"Negates all effects of [weather]{mechanic:weather}, but does not prevent the weather itself.","While this Pokémon is in battle, [weather]{mechanic:weather} can still be in play, but will not have any of its effects.

This ability functions identically to []{ability:cloud-nine}."
77,9,Doubles [evasion]{mechanic:evasion} when [confused]{mechanic:confusion}.,"When this Pokémon is [confused]{mechanic:confusion}, it has twice its [evasion]{mechanic:evasion}."
78,9,"Absorbs []{type:electric} moves, raising [Speed]{mechanic:speed} one [stage]{mechanic:stat-modifier}.","Whenever an []{type:electric}-type move hits this Pokémon, its [Speed]{mechanic:speed} rises one [stage]{mechanic:stat-modifier}, negating any other effect on it.

This ability will not take effect if this Pokémon is immune to Electric moves.  Electric moves will ignore this Pokémon's []{move:substitute}.

This effect includes non-damaging moves, i.e. []{move:thunder-wave}."
79,9,"Increases damage inflicted to 1.25× against Pokémon of the same gender, but decreases damage to 0.75× against the opposite gender.","This Pokémon inflicts 1.25× as much [regular damage]{mechanic:regular-damage} against Pokémon of the same gender and 0.75× as much regular damage against Pokémon of the opposite gender.

If either Pokémon is genderless, damage is unaffected."
80,9,Raises [Speed]{mechanic:speed} one [stage]{mechanic:stat-modifier} upon [flinching]{mechanic:flinching}.,"Whenever this Pokémon [flinches]{mechanic:flinching}, its [Speed]{mechanic:speed} rises one [stage]{mechanic:stat-modifier}."
81,9,Increases evasion to 1.25× during [hail]{mechanic:hail}.  Protects against hail damage.,"During [hail]{mechanic:hail}, this Pokémon has 1.25× its [evasion]{mechanic:evasion}, and it does not take hail damage regardless of type.

The evasion bonus does not count as a [stat modifier]{mechanic:stat-modifier}.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is halved in snow."
82,9,Makes the Pokémon eat any held Berry triggered by low [HP]{mechanic:hp} below 1/2 its max HP.,"This Pokémon eats any held Berry triggered by low [HP]{mechanic:hp} when it falls below 50% of its HP, regardless of the Berry's usual threshold."
83,9,Raises [Attack]{mechanic:attack} to the maximum of six [stages]{mechanic:stat-modifier} upon receiving a [critical hit]{mechanic:critical-hit}.,"Whenever this Pokémon receives a [critical hit]{mechanic:critical-hit}, its [Attack]{mechanic:attack} rises to the maximum of 6 [stages]{mechanic:stat-modifier}.

85,9,Halves damage from []{type:fire} moves and [burns]{mechanic:burn}.,This Pokémon takes half as much damage from []{type:fire}-type moves and [burns]{mechanic:burn}.
86,9,Doubles the Pokémon's [stat modifiers]{mechanic:stat-modifiers}.  These doubled modifiers are still capped at -6 or 6 stages.,"Each stage of this Pokémon's [stat modifiers]{mechanic:stat-modifiers} acts as two stages.  These doubled stages are still limited to a minimum of -6 and a maximum of 6.

This Pokémon can still accumulate less than -3 or more than 3 stages of stat modifiers, even though the extra ones have no effect after doubling."
87,9,"Causes 1/8 max [HP]{mechanic:hp} in damage each turn during [strong sunlight]{mechanic:strong-sunlight}, but heals for 1/8 max HP during [rain]{mechanic:rain}.

88,9,Raises the attack stat corresponding to the opponents' weaker defense one [stage]{mechanic:stat-modifier} upon entering battle.,"When this Pokémon enters battle, its [Attack]{mechanic:attack} or [Special Attack]{mechanic:special-attack}, whichever corresponds to its opponents' weaker total defensive stat, rises one [stage]{mechanic:stat-modifier}.  In the event of a tie, Special Attack is raised.

This ability also takes effect when acquired during a battle."
89,9,Strengthens punch-based moves to 1.2× their power.,"Moves flagged as being punch-based have 1.2× their base power for this Pokémon.

[]{move:sucker-punch} is not flagged as punch-based; its original, Japanese name only means ""surprise attack""."
90,9,Heals for 1/8 max [HP]{mechanic:hp} after each turn when [poisoned]{mechanic:poison} in place of damage.,"If this Pokémon is [poisoned]{mechanic:poison}, it will heal for 1/8 of its maximum [HP]{mechanic:hp} after each turn rather than taking damage.  This includes bad poison."
91,9,Increases the [same-type attack bonus]{mechanic:same-type-attack-bonus} from 1.5× to 2×.,"This Pokémon inflicts twice as much damage with moves whose types match its own, rather than the usual [same-type attack bonus]{mechanic:same-type-attack-bonus} of 1.5×."
92,9,Extends two-to-five-hit moves and []{move:triple-kick} to their full length every time.,"This Pokémon always hits five times with two-to-five-hit moves, such as []{move:icicle-spear}.  It also bypasses the accuracy checks on []{move:triple-kick}'s second and third hits."
93,9,Cures any [major status ailment]{mechanic:major-status-ailment} after each turn during [rain]{mechanic:rain}.,This Pokémon is cured of any [major status ailment]{mechanic:major-status-ailment} after each turn during [rain]{mechanic:rain}.
94,9,Increases [Special Attack]{mechanic:special-attack} to 1.5× but costs 1/8 max [HP]{mechanic:hp} after each turn during [strong sunlight]{mechanic:strong-sunlight}.,"During [strong sunlight]{mechanic:strong-sunlight}, this Pokémon has 1.5× its [Special Attack]{mechanic:special-attack} but takes 1/8 of its maximum [HP]{mechanic:hp} in damage after each turn."
95,9,Increases [Speed]{mechanic:speed} to 1.5× with a [major status ailment]{mechanic:major-status-ailment}.,"Whenever this Pokémon has a [major status ailment]{mechanic:major-status-ailment}, it has 1.5× its [Speed]{mechanic:speed}.  This Pokémon is not affected by the usual Speed cut from [paralysis]{mechanic:paralysis}.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is halved."
96,9,Makes the Pokémon's moves all act []{type:normal}-type.,"This Pokémon's moves all act as if they were []{type:normal}-type.

Moves that inflict [typeless damage]{mechanic:typeless-damage} do so as usual.  Moves of variable type, such as []{move:hidden-power}, are affected.  They otherwise work as usual, however; []{move:weather-ball}, for example, is always forced to be Normal, but it still has doubled power and looks different during [weather]{mechanic:weather}.

As []{move:thunder-wave} is prevented by immunities, unlike most non-damaging moves, it does not affect []{type:ghost}-type Pokémon under the effect of this ability."
97,9,Strengthens [critical hits]{mechanic:critical-hit} to inflict 3× damage rather than 2×.,"This Pokémon inflicts triple damage with [critical hits]{mechanic:critical-hit}, rather than the usual double damage."
98,9,Protects against damage not directly caused by a move.,"This Pokémon is immune to damage not directly caused by a move.

For example, this Pokémon takes no damage from from [weather]{mechanic:weather}, recoil, [status ailments]{mechanic:status-ailments}, or []{move:spikes}, but it still suffers from the [Attack]{mechanic:attack} cut when [burned]{mechanic:burn}, and a []{item:life-orb} will still power up this Pokémon's moves without damaging it.  Anything that directly depends on such damage will also not happen; for example, []{move:leech-seed} will neither hurt this Pokémon nor heal the opponent, and Pokémon with a []{item:jaboca-berry} or []{item:rowap-berry} will not consume the berry when hit by this Pokémon.

The following are unaffected: []{move:struggle}, []{move:pain-split} (whether used by or against this Pokémon), []{move:belly-drum}, []{move:substitute}, []{move:curse}, moves that knock the user out, and damage from [confusion]{mechanic:confusion}.

This Pokémon will neither lose nor regain [HP]{mechanic:hp} if it drains HP from a Pokémon with []{ability:liquid-ooze}.

If this Pokémon is [badly poisoned]{mechanic:poison}, the poison counter is still increased each turn; if the Pokémon loses this ability, it will begin taking as much damage as it would be if it had been taking increasing damage each turn."
99,9,Ensures all moves used by and against the Pokémon hit.,"Moves used by or against this Pokémon never miss.

One-hit KO moves are unaffected.  Moves affected by this ability can hit Pokémon during the preparation turn of moves like []{move:dig} or []{move:fly}.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is doubled."
100,9,Makes the Pokémon move last within its move's priority bracket.,"This Pokémon moves last within its priority bracket.

Multiple Pokémon with this ability move in order of [Speed]{mechanic:speed} amongst themselves.

The []{item:full-incense} and []{item:lagging-tail} take precedence over this ability; that is, Pokémon with these items move after Pokémon with this ability.  Pokémon with both this ability and one of these items are delayed as much as if they had only the item.

This ability works as usual during []{move:trick-room}: Pokémon with this ability will move in reverse order of Speed after Pokémon without it."
101,9,Strengthens moves of 60 base power or less to 1.5× their power.,"This Pokémon's moves have 1.5× their power if their base power is 60 or less.

This includes moves of variable power, such as []{move:hidden-power} and []{move:magnitude}, when their power is 60 or less.  []{move:helping-hand}'s power boost is taken into account for any move, as is []{move:defense-curl}'s power boost for []{move:rollout}."
102,9,Protects against [major status ailments]{mechanic:major-status-ailments} during [strong sunlight]{mechanic:strong-sunlight}.,"This Pokémon cannot be given a [major status ailment]{mechanic:major-status-ailment} during [strong sunlight]{mechanic:strong-sunlight}.

This ability does not heal prior status ailments.  []{move:rest} will fail altogether with this ability in effect.  []{move:yawn} will immediately fail if used on this Pokémon during strong sunlight, and an already-used Yawn will fail if the weather turns to strong sunlight in the meantime."
103,9,Prevents the Pokémon from using its held item in battle.,"In battle, this Pokémon cannot use its held item, nor will the item have any passive effect on the battle, positive or negative.  This Pokémon also cannot use []{move:fling}.

The [Speed]{mechanic:speed} cut from the []{item:iron-ball} and the effort items (the []{item:macho-brace}, []{item:power-weight}, []{item:power-bracer}, []{item:power-belt}, []{item:power-lens}, []{item:power-band}, and []{item:power-anklet}) is unaffected.  Items that do not directly affect the battle, such as the []{item:exp-share}, the []{item:amulet-coin}, or the []{item:soothe-bell}, work as usual.  All held items work as usual out of battle.

Other moves that use the held item, such as []{move:natural-gift} and []{move:switcheroo}, work as usual."
104,9,Bypasses targets' abilities if they could hinder or prevent a move.,"This Pokémon's moves completely ignore abilities that could hinder or prevent their effect on the target.

For example, this Pokémon's moves ignore abilities that would fully negate them, such as []{ability:water-absorb}; abilities that would prevent any of their effects, such as []{ability:clear-body}, []{ability:shell-armor}, or []{ability:sticky-hold}; and abilities that grant any general protective benefit, such as []{ability:simple}, []{ability:snow-cloak}, or []{ability:thick-fat}.  If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. []{ability:dry-skin} or []{ability:unaware}, the ability is ignored either way.

Abilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected.  For example, []{ability:cursed-body} only affects potential future uses of the move, while []{ability:liquid-ooze} and []{ability:shadow-tag} can only hinder a move's effect on the user.  This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example []{ability:color-change} or []{ability:forecast}; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from []{ability:drizzle}.  This ability cannot ignore []{ability:multitype} at all.

An ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  For example, this Pokémon's moves can [paralyze]{mechanic:paralysis} a Pokémon with []{ability:limber}, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's []{move:spikes} are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.

When this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.

This ability functions identically to []{ability:teravolt} and []{ability:turboblaze}."
105,9,Raises moves' [critical hit]{mechanic:critical-hit} rates one stage.,This Pokémon's moves have [critical hit]{mechanic:critical-hit} rates one stage higher than normal.
106,9,Damages the attacker for 1/4 its max [HP]{mechanic:hp} when knocked out by a contact move.,"When this Pokémon is knocked out by a move that makes contact, the move's user takes 1/4 its maximum [HP]{mechanic:hp} in damage."
107,9,"Notifies all trainers upon entering battle if an opponent has a [super-effective]{mechanic:super-effective} move, []{move:self-destruct}, []{move:explosion}, or a one-hit KO move.","When this Pokémon enters battle, if one of its opponents has a move that is [super effective]{mechanic:super-effective} against it, []{move:self-destruct}, []{move:explosion}, or a one-hit knockout move, all participating trainers are notified.

The move itself is not revealed; only that there is such a move.  Moves that inflict [typeless damage]{mechanic:typeless-damage}, such as []{move:future-sight}, and moves of variable type, such as []{move:hidden-power}, count as their listed types.  []{move:counter}, []{move:metal-burst}, []{move:mirror-coat}, and one-hit KO moves to which this Pokémon is immune do not trigger this ability."
108,9,Reveals the opponents' strongest move upon entering battle.,"When this Pokémon enters battle, it reveals the move with the highest base power known by any opposing Pokémon to all participating trainers.

In the event of a tie, one is chosen at random.

Moves without a listed base power are assigned one as follows:

Power | Moves
----: | -----
  160 | One-hit KO moves: []{move:fissure}, []{move:guillotine}, []{move:horn-drill}, and []{move:sheer-cold}
  120 | Counter moves: []{move:counter}, []{move:metal-burst}, and []{move:mirror-coat}
   80 | Variable power or set damage: []{move:crush-grip}, []{move:dragon-rage}, []{move:electro-ball}, []{move:endeavor}, []{move:final-gambit}, []{move:flail}, []{move:frustration}, []{move:grass-knot}, []{move:gyro-ball}, []{move:heat-crash}, []{move:heavy-slam}, []{move:hidden-power}, []{move:low-kick}, []{move:natural-gift}, []{move:night-shade}, []{move:psywave}, []{move:return}, []{move:reversal}, []{move:seismic-toss}, []{move:sonic-boom}, []{move:trump-card}, and []{move:wring-out}
    0 | Any such move not listed
"
109,9,Ignores other Pokémon's stat modifiers for damage and accuracy calculation.,"This Pokémon ignores other Pokémon's [stat modifiers]{mechanic:stat-modifiers} for the purposes of damage and accuracy calculation.

Effectively, this affects modifiers of every stat except [Speed]{mechanic:speed}.

The power of []{move:punishment} and []{move:stored-power} is calculated as usual.  When this Pokémon hurts itself in [confusion]{mechanic:confusion}, its stat modifiers affect damage as usual."
110,9,Doubles damage inflicted with [not-very-effective]{mechanic:not-very-effective} moves.,This Pokémon deals twice as much damage with moves that are [not very effective]{mechanic:not-very-effective} against the target.
111,9,Decreases damage taken from [super-effective]{mechanic:super-effective} moves by 1/4.,"This Pokémon takes 0.75× as much damage from moves that are [super effective]{mechanic:super-effective} against it.

This ability functions identically to []{ability:solid-rock}."
112,9,Halves [Attack]{mechanic:attack} and [Speed]{mechanic:speed} for five turns upon entering battle.,"This Pokémon's [Attack]{mechanic:attack} and [Speed]{mechanic:speed} are halved for five turns upon entering battle.

This ability also takes effect when acquired during battle.  If this Pokémon loses its ability before the five turns are up, its Attack and Speed return to normal; if it then regains this ability without leaving battle, its Attack and Speed are halved again, but the counter keeps counting from where it was."
113,9,Lets the Pokémon's []{type:normal} and []{type:fighting} moves hit []{type:ghost} Pokémon.,"This Pokémon ignores []{type:ghost}-type Pokémon's immunity to []{type:normal}- and []{type:fighting}-type moves.

Ghost Pokémon's other types affect damage as usual."
114,9,"Redirects single-target []{type:water} moves to this Pokémon where possible.  Absorbs Water moves, raising [Special Attack]{mechanic:special-attack} one [stage]{mechanic:stat-modifier}.","All other Pokémon's single-target []{type:water}-type moves are redirected to this Pokémon, if it is an eligible target.  Other Pokémon's Water moves raise this Pokémon's [Special Attack]{mechanic:special-attack} one [stage]{mechanic:stat-modifier}, negating any other effect on it, and cannot miss it.

If the move's intended target also has this ability, the move is not redirected.  When multiple Pokémon with this ability are possible targets for redirection, the move is redirected to the one with the highest [Speed]{mechanic:speed} stat, or, in the case of a tie, to a random tied Pokémon.  []{move:follow-me} takes precedence over this ability."
115,9,Heals for 1/16 max [HP]{mechanic:hp} after each turn during hail.  Protects against hail damage.,"This Pokémon heals for 1/16 of its maximum [HP]{mechanic:hp} after each turn during [hail]{mechanic:hail}, and it does not take hail damage regardless of type."
116,9,Decreases damage taken from [super-effective]{mechanic:super-effective} moves by 1/4.,"This Pokémon takes 0.75× as much damage from moves that are [super effective]{mechanic:super-effective} against it.

This ability functions identically to []{ability:filter}."
117,9,Summons [hail]{mechanic:hail} that lasts indefinitely upon entering battle.,"The [weather]{mechanic:weather} changes to [hail]{mechanic:hail} when this Pokémon enters battle and does not end unless cancelled by another weather condition.

If multiple Pokémon with this ability, []{ability:drizzle}, []{ability:drought}, or []{ability:sand-stream} are sent out at the same time, the abilities will activate in order of [Speed]{mechanic:speed}, respecting []{move:trick-room}.  Each ability's weather will cancel the previous weather, and only the weather summoned by the slowest of the Pokémon will stay."
118,9,The Pokémon may pick up []{item:honey} after battle.,"This Pokémon has a chance of picking up []{item:honey} after each battle.  This chance starts at 5% and rises another 5% after every tenth level: 5% from level 1–10, 10% from 11–20, and so on, up to 50% from 91–100.

This ability is checked after the battle ends, at which point any temporary ability changes have worn off."
119,9,Reveals an opponent's held item upon entering battle.,"When this Pokémon enters battle, it reveals an opposing Pokémon's held item to all participating trainers.

In a double battle, if one opponent has an item, this Pokémon will Frisk that Pokémon; if both have an item, it will Frisk one at random."
120,9,Strengthens recoil moves to 1.2× their power.,"This Pokémon's recoil moves and crash moves have 1.2× their base power.

[]{move:struggle} is unaffected.

The ""crash moves"" are the moves that damage the user upon missing: []{move:jump-kick} and []{move:high-jump-kick}."
121,9,Changes []{pokemon:arceus}'s type and form to match its held Plate.,"If this Pokémon is holding an elemental Plate, its type and form change to match the Plate.

This Pokémon's held item, whether or not it is a Plate, cannot be taken by []{move:covet} or []{move:thief}, nor removed by []{move:knock-off}, nor traded by []{move:switcheroo} or []{move:trick}.  Covet, Thief, and Knock Off still inflict damage against this Pokémon.  Unlike with []{ability:sticky-hold}, this Pokémon cannot use []{move:fling}, Switcheroo, or Trick to lose its item itself, nor gain an item through Switcheroo or Trick if it does not have one.

This ability has no effect for any Pokémon other than []{pokemon:arceus}.  This ability cannot be traded with []{move:skill-swap}, nor copied with []{move:role-play} or []{ability:trace}, nor disabled with []{move:gastro-acid}, nor changed with []{move:worry-seed}.  This Pokémon cannot use Skill Swap or Role Play to lose its ability itself.  []{ability:mold-breaker} cannot ignore this ability.

If a Pokémon [Transforms]{move:transform} into an Arceus with this ability, it will Transform into Arceus's default, []{type:normal}-type form.  If the Transforming Pokémon is holding a Plate, this ability will then activate and change the Pokémon into the corresponding form."
122,9,Increases friendly Pokémon's [Attack]{mechanic:attack} and [Special Defense]{mechanic:special-defense} to 1.5× during [strong sunlight]{mechanic:strong-sunlight}.,"Friendly Pokémon have 1.5× their [Attack]{mechanic:attack} and [Special Defense]{mechanic:special-defense} during [strong sunlight]{mechanic:strong-sunlight} if any friendly Pokémon has this ability.

Unlike []{ability:forecast}, []{ability:multitype}, and []{ability:zen-mode}, this ability is not tied to its Pokémon's form change; []{pokemon:cherrim} will switch between its forms even if it loses this ability.  As such, this ability also works if obtained by a Pokémon other than Cherrim."
123,9,Damages [sleeping]{mechanic:sleep} opponents for 1/8 their max [HP]{mechanic:hp} after each turn.,Opposing Pokémon take 1/8 of their maximum [HP]{mechanic:hp} in damage after each turn while they are [asleep]{mechanic:asleep}.
124,9,Steals attacking Pokémon's held items on contact.,"Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, if it does not have a held item, it steals the attacker's held item.

This Pokémon cannot steal upon being knocked out.  It can steal if the attacker has a []{move:substitute}, but cannot steal when its own Substitute is hit.  If a move hits multiple times, only the last hit triggers this ability.  If this Pokémon is wild, it cannot steal from a trained Pokémon."
125,9,"Strengthens moves with extra effects to 1.3× their power, but prevents their extra effects.","This Pokémon's moves with extra effects have 1.3× their power, but lose their extra effects.

An effect chance is a move's chance to inflict a status ailment, cause a stat change, or make the target flinch in addition to the move's main effect. For example, []{move:thunder-shock}'s paralysis is an extra effect, but []{move:thunder-wave}'s is not, nor are []{move:knock-off}'s item removal and []{move:air-cutter}'s increased [critical hit]{mechanic:critical-hit} rate.

Moves that lower the user's stats are unaffected."
126,9,Inverts [stat changes]{mechanic:stat-modifiers}.,"Whenever this Pokémon's stats would be [raised]{mechanic:stat-modifiers}, they are instead lowered by the same amount, and vice versa."

Affected Pokémon can still use []{move:bug-bite} or []{move:pluck} to eat a target's Berry."
128,9,Raises [Attack]{mechanic:attack} two [stages]{mechanic:stat-modifier} upon having any stat lowered.,"When any of this Pokémon's stats are [lowered]{mechanic:stat-modifier}, its [Attack]{mechanic:attack} rises by two stages.

If multiple stats are lowered at once, this ability takes effect with each stat lowered."

131,9,Has a 30% chance of curing each adjacent ally of any [major status ailment]{mechanic:major-status-ailment} after each turn.,Friendly Pokémon next to this Pokémon in double and triple battles each have a 30% chance of being cured of any [major status ailment]{mechanic:major-status-ailment} after each turn.
132,9,Decreases all direct damage taken by friendly Pokémon to 0.75×.,"All friendly Pokémon take 0.75× as much direct damage from moves while this Pokémon is in battle.

This effect stacks if multiple allied Pokémon have it."
133,9,Raises [Speed]{mechanic:speed} and lowers [Defense]{mechanic:defense} by one stage each upon being hit by a physical move.,"Whenever a physical move hits this Pokémon, its [Speed]{mechanic:speed} rises one stage and its [Defense]{mechanic:defense} falls one stage.
