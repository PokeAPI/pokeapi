If Rotom only knows its signature move upon reverting to its default form, it learns []{move:thunder-shock} to avoid having no moves.

Appliances for switching Rotom's form can be found in the following locations, depending on the game:

* Platinum: In the Team Galactic Eterna Building.  Requires a []{item:secret-key}.
